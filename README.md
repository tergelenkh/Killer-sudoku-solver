# Killer Sudoku Solver

[Killer Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_sudoku) is a captivating variation of the classic [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_code) puzzle that combines the logic-based structure of Sudoku with the mathematical elements of addition. In Killer Sudoku, the traditional 9x9 grid is divided into irregularly shaped "cages," each with a target sum. Players must fill the grid with numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring no repetition in rows, columns, or sub-grids, while also meeting the sum requirements of each cage. This added layer of complexity makes Killer Sudoku both challenging and rewarding for puzzle enthusiasts.

The inspiration for this project stems from my personal passion for playing Sudoku. As someone who has always found joy in solving puzzles, I wanted to explore the game further and create something unique that blends my interest in Killer Sudoku with new ideas. By working on this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of the game.
